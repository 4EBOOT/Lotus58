# Lotus 58

Starting with simple tweaks to the Lily58 Glow before ordering a set of PCB's it quickly spiraled out of control, and I ended up with what wasn't quite a Lily58 anymore, and although very similar in layout, is no longer compatible with plate and case design. 

Because of this it was renamed to Lotus58, referencing another flower much like the lily in the name Lily58.

# Lotus 58 Glow

- Layout very similar to the original Lily58 family
- Per key RGB and RGB underglow
- Kaihl Hot-swap sockets for MX compatible switches
- 0.91" OLED Screen
- Optional layout for retaining all 58 keys and adding a rotary encoder per side (Removes OLED screen for that side)  
- Optional layout swapping upper thumb key for a rotary encoder (Retains OLED screen, cannot be combined with above for two encoders per side)
